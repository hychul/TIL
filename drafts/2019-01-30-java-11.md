[JEP 181: Nest-Based Access Control](https://metebalci.com/blog/what-is-new-in-java-11/#jep-181-nest-based-access-control)

```java
import java.lang.reflect.Field;

public class JEP181 {
  public static class Nest1 {
    private int varNest1;

    public void f() throws Exception {
      final Nest2 nest2 = new Nest2();
        
      // this is ok
      nest2.varNest2 = 2;
        
      // this is not ok
      final Field f2 = Nest2.class.getDeclaredField("varNest2");
      f2.setInt(nest2, 2);
    }
  }

  public static class Nest2 {
    private int varNest2;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    new Nest1().f();
  }
}
```

Above, JEP181 is called the top level type, and together with Nest1 and Nest2, they are nestmates. Because they are nestmates, Nest1 can access the private field varNest2 of nested class Nest2 (line 14). However, if you use reflection as in lines 17â€“18, it raises an IllegalAccessException. JEP181 solves this problem, thus using reflection here is not going to raise an exception and will work as excepted.

[JEP 309: Dynamic Class-File Constants](https://metebalci.com/blog/what-is-new-in-java-11/#jep-309-dynamic-class-file-constants)

A new constant pool entry CONSTANT_Dynamic will be added to the class files where the creation of such an entry will be delegated to bootstrap method like invokedynamic call site delegates at runtime.

[JEP 315: Improve Aarch64 Intrinsics](https://metebalci.com/blog/what-is-new-in-java-11/#jep-315-improve-aarch64-intrinsics)

As the name indicates, intrinsics, such as for Math.cos and sin, used for (ARM) AArch64 architecture are improved.

[JEP 318: Epsilon: A No-Op Garbage Collector](https://metebalci.com/blog/what-is-new-in-java-11/#jep-318-epsilon-a-no-op-garbage-collector)

Epsilon is a do nothing Garbage Collector, meaning it is actually not a garbage collector, it will not collect any garbage (memory allocation). It can be used for various reasons as listed in the JEP description, such as performance testing or extremely short lived jobs.

[JEP 320: Remove the Java EE and CORBA Modules](https://metebalci.com/blog/what-is-new-in-java-11/#jep-320-remove-the-java-ee-and-corba-modules)

Already deprecated in Java 9, Java EE and CORBA Modules are removed. This means:

- Following packages are removed: `java.xml.ws, java.xml.bind, java.activation, java.xml.ws.annotation, java.corba, java.transaction, java.se.ee, jdk.xml.ws, jdk.xml.bind`
- Following tools are removed: `wsgen, wsimport, schemagen, xjc, idlj, orbd, servertool, tnames`
- The JNDI CosNamingProvider is removed.
- Java RMI Compiler (rmic) will no longer produce IDL or IIOP stubs, thus -iiop and -idl flags will be removed.

[JEP 321: HTTP Client (Standard)](https://metebalci.com/blog/what-is-new-in-java-11/#jep-321-http-client-standard)

The incubated HTTP Client API in Java 9 and 10 is standardized under the module `java.net.http`. This API supports both HTTP 1.1 and 2 and WebSocket through main types `HttpClient`, `HttpRequest`, `HttpResponse` and `WebSocket` and both sync and async operations.

Here is an example:

```java
import java.net.http.HttpClient;
import java.net.http.HttpClient.Version;
import java.net.http.HttpRequest;
import java.net.http.HttpResponse;
import java.net.http.HttpResponse.BodyHandlers;
import java.net.URI;

public class JEP321 {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

		final HttpClient hc = HttpClient.newBuilder()
			.version(Version.HTTP_2)
			.build();

		final HttpRequest req = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
			.uri(URI.create("https://metebalci.com"))
			.build();

		final HttpResponse<String> resSync = hc.send(req, BodyHandlers.ofString());

		System.out.println(resSync.statusCode());

		hc.sendAsync(req, BodyHandlers.ofString())
			.thenApply(HttpResponse::statusCode)
			.thenAccept(System.out::println)
			.get();

	}

}
```

[JEP 323: Local-Variable Syntax for Lambda Parameters](https://metebalci.com/blog/what-is-new-in-java-11/#jep-323-local-variable-syntax-for-lambda-parameters)

Java 10 introduces var for local variables. However, it was not possible to use it in lambda expressions, JEP 323 resolves this problem. So the following code, with `(var a) -> a < 5`, now runs on Java 11.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class JEP323 {

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    var xs = new int[]{3, 2, 6, 4, 8, 9};

    int x = Arrays.stream(xs).filter((var a) -> a < 5).sum();

    System.out.println(x);

  }

}
```

[JEP 324: Key Agreement with Curve25519 and Curve448](https://metebalci.com/blog/what-is-new-in-java-11/#jep-324-key-agreement-with-curve25519-and-curve448)

RFC 7748, the key agreement using Curve25519 and Curve448 is implemented in SunEC provider.

[JEP 327: Unicode 10](https://metebalci.com/blog/what-is-new-in-java-11/#jep-327-unicode-10)

Java 11 will support Unicode 10. Since Java 10 supports Unicode 8, that means both Unicode 9 and Unicode 10 changes will be implemented. However, Unicode Collation Algorithm, Unicode Security Mechanisms, Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing, and Unicode Emoji will not be implemented.

[JEP 328: Flight Recorder](https://metebalci.com/blog/what-is-new-in-java-11/#jep-328-flight-recorder)

Flight Recorder is a low overhead (under 1% performance impact) data / event collection framework. Applications, JVM or OS can produce data as events, and these will be buffered and serialized to a binary format, and then can be consumed for various means, such as troubleshooting.

This deserves a post on its own, but a simple demonstration is here. This example writes an event every second if run with an argument, otherwise, it reads the `1.out` event output and dumps its contents.

```java
import jdk.jfr.*;
import jdk.jfr.consumer.*;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.util.List;

public class JEP328 extends Event {

  @Label("message")
  String message;

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

    if (args.length > 0) {

      for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {

        final JEP328 j = new JEP328();
        j.message = String.valueOf(i);
        j.commit();

        Thread.sleep(1000);

      }

    } else {

      Path p = Paths.get("1.out");
      for (RecordedEvent e : RecordingFile.readAllEvents(p)) {
        final List<ValueDescriptor> lvd = e.getFields();
        System.out.println(e.getStartTime());
        for (ValueDescriptor vd : lvd) {
          System.out.println(vd.getLabel() + "=" + e.getValue(vd.getName()));
        }
        System.out.println("***");
      }

    }

  }
}
```

We can run it with flight recorder using `-XX:StartFlightRecording` option.

```bash
$ java -XX:StartFlightRecording JEP328 x
Started recording 1. No limit specified, using maxsize=250MB as default.

Use jcmd 27866 JFR.dump name=1 filename=FILEPATH to copy recording data to file.
```

Then, at any time, we can dump the events.

```bash
$ jcmd 27866 JFR.dump name=1 filename=1.out
27866:
Dumped recording "1", 236.6 kB written to:

/home/mete/Dropbox/metebalci.com/includes/1.out
```

If we dumpt the contents of events:

```bash
$ java JEP328
```

There are many, but this is one of the events we wrote:

[JEP 330: Launch Single-File Source-Code Programs](https://metebalci.com/blog/what-is-new-in-java-11/#jep-330-launch-single-file-source-code-programs)

It will be possible to run a single-file Java source-code like:

```bash
java SourceCode.java
```

which will be roughly equivalent to:

```bash
javac -d <memory> SourceCode.java
java -cp <memory> ClassInSourceCodeJava
```

This will also make it possible to add `#!path-to-java -source 11` to the first line of the file, make it executable and directly run. For this, change the file extension something other than `.java`.

[JEP 331: Low-Overhead Heap Profiling](https://metebalci.com/blog/what-is-new-in-java-11/#jep-331-low-overhead-heap-profiling)

With the new JVMTI SampledObjectAlloc callback, it will be possible to trace the (individual or sampled) heap allocations and their locations in a low-overhead framework.
